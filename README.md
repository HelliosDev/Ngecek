# Ngecek

Ngecek is an app for scanning Batik Pattern for getting information based on the Batik scanned.

## Personal Story

I really want to learn about Coding Convention (for Swift). Why? Because it really helps in improving the readability and clarity of the code. Imagine if the code is really messy and you read the code again after 2 years, It will be extremely hard to understand the logic behind the code. For additional learning purpose, i also learn on creating Machine Learning, because it's the field which i have been always interested in. I pick Batik as the topic, because it's one of the cultural heritage which is loved by my Country. People also tends to find it hard upon searching for Batik Info, because not all of them have the knowledge about Batik Pattern itself. This project is generated to help those who need information about particular Batik.

## Getting Started

This project contains the finished code and it's ready to run. You are free to use the **.mlmodel** provided in this project or generate your own **.mlmodel** using Create ML. You can also find the API for data purpose in [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).

## Usage

Here are some examples of the project's outcome. This project contains the feature of scanning and providing information.
